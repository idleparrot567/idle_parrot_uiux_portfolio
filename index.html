				<h1>Persona and Story Board</h1>
				<h5>HW1 CSCI1300 UIUX, October 2nd, 2022</h5>
				<h2>Project Context:</h2>
				<p>
					The goal of the project is to understand a publicly visible user interface and design its users personas 
					and journey. 
				</p>
				<h2>About the Interface:</h2>
				<p>The User Interface that I observed for this project is the card reader at Brown University Mail room. 
					The Card reader, painted in black, are either hanged perpendicularly or displayed on a titled desk. The design 
					of the card reader is fairly simple. It has a gap for the users to swipe the card. On the side where the gap locates,
					the designer put a carved arrow, signalling the direction that the users should swipe their card. Right next to the arrow, 
					the designer also places an image of a card with its back side facing the user, signalling that the user should insert the card with its 
					bar code facing the arrows.</p>

				</div>
				<h2>Interview Experience and Questions:</h2>
				<p>
					On Friday 9/30, I spent 20 mins sitting in the mail room, looking at people swiping their cards to get their packages and letters. There are two groups of 
					card readers in the mail room: one situate outside of the mail room that allow students to swipe in to get into the queue, the other hanged perpendicularly on the 
					computers that allow students to confirm that they have received the packages. The handling of the second group of machines are supervised by mail room staffs, 
					while the first group of interfaces are not. Besides the long waiting time for getting the packages, I noticed that, among all the users that I observed, about 60% percent of them 
					failed to get their card read by the machine with just one swipe. The repeated operation due to error mainly occured when using the first group of machines. Without the 
					extra instructions given by the staffs, some students ended up frantically swiping their cards for multiple times, 
					ignoring the warning that repeated swiping would delay their package processing. To find out more about the seeming difficulty in using this interface,
					I asked the following questions to three random students:
				</p>

				<ol type="1">
					<li>What is your first impression of this card reader?</li>
					<li>What do you expect to happen if you did this [swiping your card]?</li>
					<li> Do you feel like the card reader provide you with enough instruction?</li>
					<li>Is there a difference in terms of your experience using the machines inside/outside the mail room door?
						If so, what do you think contribute to this difference?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you find this interface successful in terms of learnability? If not, what would you suggest in terms of improving it?
					</li>
				  </ol>  
				  <p>
					The responses that I got from interviews are quite interesting:
				</p>
				  <ul>
					<li>All interviewees' initially thought the card reader to be intuitive and expected it to be quite easy to use.</li>
					<li>All of them agree the affordance of the card reader is strong and the gap provides clear visual cues for swiping.  </li>
					<li> However, all of them have experienced failures using the card readers. For the machines outside, the error was mainly 
						caused by inserting the card at wrong direction. For the machine inside, the perpendicular placement of the machine won't 
						allow readers to exert enough pressure for the card to be read. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Most of the interviewees find the image signalling inserting direction useless. All of the interviewees suggest that
						the designer should have put the image in a different color other than black for a better visual cue. Some of the interviewees
						further suggested that the perpendicular placement of the card reader inside the mail room also hinders them from reading the cues and
						using the machine properly.
					</li>
					<li>
						Most of the interviewees find using the card reader frustrating. However, due to the simplicity of the operation, the interface
						is quite easy to learn. 
					</li>
				  </ul>

				<h2>The Construction of Two Personas: Identify Users</h2>
				<p>
					The users of the card reader machines at Brown mail rooms mainly consist of Brown students. However,
					Brown students include a wide range of characters, and we present you with two persona here:
				</p>
				<div class="gallery">
					<img class="img" src="./1-1.jpg" alt="Christina, a online shopping fan" style="height:500px;" id="persona_1">

					<!--style="height:200px;"-->
				</div>
				
				<h2>A Story Board</h2>
				<p>
					So what kind of user journey would these persona went through when using the card reader at Brown University Mail room? 
					Let's find out together in the following two graphs, each grid depicting one moment of Christina, our online shopping fan friend's 
					experience using the interface.

				  <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
				  <h5>HW2 CSCI1300 UIUX, October 16th, 2022</h5>
				  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
				  <p>
					The website that I am redesigning for this project is the website of <a href="http://fitzgeraldfamilyrabbitry.weebly.com/our-bunnies.html"> Fitsgerald Family Rabbitry</a>,
					reputable local business that adopt and breed rabbits such as the Netherland Dwarf. As a animal lover,
					I am interested in helping local animal breeders present their works on the internet in better forms. 
					<div class="gallery">
						<img class="img" src="2-1.png" alt="Screen shot of Fitzgerald Family Rabbitry's website" style="height:550px;" id="rr_1"> 
					</div>
				  </p>
				  <h2>Finding Problems</h2>
				  <p>
					Refering back to the lecture on the ten usability heuristics, I identify following problems with the above web page:
					<div class="gallery">
						<img class="img" src="2-2.png" alt="Problems identified with Fitzgerald Family Rabbitry's website" style="height:300px;" id="rr_2"> 
					</div>
				  </p>
				  <h2> Accessibility Assessment</h2>
				  <p>
					  To further test the website's accesibility, I put the breeder's page into the WAVE (web accesibility evaluation tool), and I got the following results:
					  <div class="gallery">
						<img class="img" src="2-3.png" alt="Problems identified with Fitzgerald Family Rabbitry's website on WAVE" style="height:400px;" id="rr_3"> 
						<h5>
						Fig.1, Problems identified with Fitzgerald Family Rabbitry's website on WAVE
						</h5>
					</div>
					I generally agree with the types of errors detected by the WAVE. Using "inspect" to check, indeed most of the pictures (except one) on the home page of the website does not have
					alternative texts. The error message suggesting the lack of first level heading corroborates the hierarchy problem that I pointed out earlier. The icon suggesting that audience can find
					more information about the breeder on Google+ does not have a link. However, the website is not built from scratch in html/css, thus there maybe some 
					error about undetectable language. 
				  </p>
				  <h2>Low-fidelity Wireframing</h2>
				  <p>
					To redesign the website, we first try to build low-fi model. 
					<div class="gallery">
						<img class="img" src="2-4.png" alt="Low Fi prototype for a computer screen" style="height:400px;" id="rr_4"> 
						<h5> Fig 2. Low Fi prototype for a computer screen</h5>

						<h5> Fig 3. Low Fi prototype for an ipad screen</h5>
						<img class="img" src="2-6.png" alt=" Low Fi prototype for an iphone screen" style="height:400px;" id="rr_6"> 
						<h5> Fig 4. Low Fi prototype for an iphone screen</h5>
					</div>
				  </p>
				  <h2> Visual Design Style Guide</h2>
				  <p>
					In order to better present my High-fi prototypes, I present the following style guide.
				  </p>
				  <div class="gallery">
					  <img class="img" src="2-7.png"alt="Visual Style Guide" style="height:400px;" id="rr_7">
					  <h5> Fig 5. The Visual Style Guide</h5>
				  </div>
				  <h2>High-Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
				  <p>Using Figma or other high-fidelity tool (like Adobe XD), create a total of 3 high-fidelity prototypes of your screen, one for each of the screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).</p>
				  <h2> Responsive Redesign</h2>
				  <p>
					Using the final high-fidelity prototypes, I create the <a href="https://idleparrot567.github.io/responsive_redesign/"> following page</a> using HTML and CSS! Buttons are only for display currently, but hope I can implement the whole project in the future.
